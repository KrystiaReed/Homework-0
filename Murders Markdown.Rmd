```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from Wikipedia.

We are going to use the following library:

```{library}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we already wrangled:

```{wrangled}
load("rdas/murders.rda")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
